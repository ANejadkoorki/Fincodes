Hello to everyone who reads this guide

There is two directory : 
- Duration dir : containing maccauly_duration implementation
- GARCH dir : that has three modules :
	
	1)the "garch_estimate_archlib" calculates GARCH(1, 1) optimum parameters(omega, alpha and beta) using arch library

	2)the "garch_estimate_hull" has a similar function but is based on the book "Risk Management and Financial Institutions" by John C. Hall

	3)the "stock_volatility_estimate" calculates the conditional volatility of the TSE stocks for an arbitrary time period and finally plots it

You can also find required packages in "requirements.txt".

I welcome your comments.
