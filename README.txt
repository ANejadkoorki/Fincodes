Hello to everyone who reads this guide

There is two directory : 
1. Duration dir : containing maccauly_duration implementation
2. GARCH dir : that has three modules
		-the "garch_estimate_archlib" calculate GARCH(1, 1) optimum parameters(omeaga, alpha and beta) using arch library
		-the "garch_estimate_hull" has same functionality but based on John C Hull "Risk Management And Financial Institutions"
		-the "stock_volatility_estimate" calculates conditional volatility of TSE stocks for arbitary time period and plots it
			at final
Also you can find the program run requirements in "requirements.txt"
